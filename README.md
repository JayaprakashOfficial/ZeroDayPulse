🔐 ZeroDayPulse – AI-Driven Zero-Day Vulnerability Prediction & Analysis
📘 Project Overview

ZeroDayPulse is an AI-powered vulnerability intelligence platform designed to predict, analyze, and explain the severity of newly disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities in real time. The system leverages machine learning models trained on historical CVE data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and enhances decision-making through natural-language explanations generated by an open-source Large Language Model (LLM).

The platform provides an interactive dashboard that enables cybersecurity analysts to identify high-risk vulnerabilities, understand attack characteristics, and prioritize remediation efforts efficiently.

📌 Problem Statement

Zero-day vulnerabilities pose a critical risk to organizations, as they are often exploited before official patches become available. Traditional CVSS scoring systems rely on manual assessment and may lag behind real-world exploitation trends.

The objective of ZeroDayPulse is to automatically predict the potential severity of newly reported vulnerabilities using AI techniques, allowing security teams to act proactively and allocate resources effectively.

🎯 Objectives

Collect and preprocess real-world CVE data from NVD feeds

Predict vulnerability severity using machine learning

Combine textual and structured vulnerability attributes

Provide real-time, interactive vulnerability analytics

Generate human-readable explanations using open-source GenAI

Enable future integration with enterprise security tools
